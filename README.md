# üõ†Ô∏è Stack Overflow Content Scraper with WordPress Auto-Publishing

## üìú Description
This Node.js project automates the scraping of data from Stack Overflow and publishes it as WordPress posts via the WordPress REST API. The process involves two main APIs:
1. **Stack Overflow Scraping API**: Scrapes data from Stack Overflow URLs and updates it in a JSON file.
2. **WordPress Publishing API**: Fetches URLs, scrapes content, and publishes it on WordPress.

## üíª Technology Stack
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building server-side applications.
- **Express**: Web application framework for Node.js.
- **WordPress**: Content management system for publishing web content.

## üì¶ Packages
The following packages are used in this project:

- `axios` - Promise-based HTTP client.
- `cheerio` - jQuery-like library for server-side DOM manipulation.
- `dotenv` - Loads environment variables from a `.env` file.
- `express` - Web framework for Node.js.
- `locate-chrome` - Finds the installed Chrome or Chromium executable.
- `moment` - Parse, validate, manipulate, and display dates and times.
- `nodemon` - Utility that monitors for changes in your source code and automatically restarts your server.
- `puppeteer` - Headless Chrome Node.js API for web scraping.
- `puppeteer-core` - Core library for Puppeteer, without the bundled Chromium.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Set Up Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and include the following variables. You can refer to the `.env.example` file for details.

```plaintext
WP_URL="<WORDPRESS SITE URL>"
WP_USER="<WORDPRESS USER>"
WP_PASSWORD="<WORDPRESS PASSWORD>"
JWT_SECRET_KEY="<JWT_SECRET_KEY>"
